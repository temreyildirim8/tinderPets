# Brief

To give you some context: we absolutely love cats! And we would love for you to build us an app that is a tinder for cats.
As explained, we sent the exercise through email and you should access here the design link (https://www.figma.com/file/QKSnYUt7BqSWN6sL0dBFZE/cat-tinder?node-id=0%3A1). If you don't have an account please create one. You have up to 5 hours if you need to, to complete the tasks and it will be available for the next 5 days (if you need more time let us know). Please be aware You can't pause the exercise (You should upload your project on Git Hub with a first commit from when it started and then the final commit before the time is up). Also, you can use the libraries you feel comfortable with, and if you do some Unit Tests that will for sure touch our hearts!
